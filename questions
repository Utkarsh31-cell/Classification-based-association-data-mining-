1.       Implement CBA (Classification-Based Association) algorithm

CBA uses an iterative approach to frequent itemset mining, similar to Apriori. 
The complete set of rules satisfying minimum confidence and minimum support thresholds are found and then analyzed for inclusion in the classifier. 
The rules are organized according to decreasing precedence based on their support and confidence. 
If a set of rules has the same antecedent, then the rule with the highest confidence is selected to 
represent the set. When classifying a new tuple, the first rule satisfying the tuple is used to classify it.
The classifier also contains a default rule, having lowest precedence, which specifies 
a default class for any new tuple that is not satisfied by any other rule in the classifier.

Consider the following dataset D to test a new tuple
